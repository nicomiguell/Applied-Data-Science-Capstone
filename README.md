# SpaceX Capstone

## Description
This project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The goal is to predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land. We used public SpaceX launch data, applied data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning techniques.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- SQL
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, Plotly
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- APIs (REST)
- Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, KNN

## What I did
- Collected data from the SpaceX API and various sources.
- Performed web scraping to gather additional data related to rocket launches.
- Cleaned and transformed the data to make it suitable for analysis.
- Explored the data using SQL queries to gain initial insights.
- Conducted data visualization to identify trends and patterns in launch outcomes.
- Analyzed launch site locations using geospatial visualizations (Folium).
- Built and evaluated machine learning models to predict the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings.
- Developed an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash to present the analysis.

## Data source
